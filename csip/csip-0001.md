# CSIP-0001: CSIP Process and Proposal Template

## Abstract

This document defines the process for proposing, reviewing, and finalizing Crypto Style Improvement Proposals (CSIPs). It also provides the canonical template that must be used when drafting new CSIPs.

CSIPs describe technical standards, interfaces, conventions, and best practices for the Crypto Style smart contract ecosystem.

---

## Motivation

A standardized proposal process ensures:

- Clear communication of technical standards
- Transparent review and discussion
- Long-term maintainability
- Interoperability between contracts and tools
- Predictable evolution of the ecosystem

Without a formal process, standards become fragmented and incompatible.

---

## Specification

### 1. What is a CSIP?

A CSIP is a design document providing information to the Crypto Style community, or describing a new feature, interface, or process.

Each CSIP must:

- Be written in Markdown
- Follow the template defined in this document
- Have a unique numeric identifier
- Be stored in the `csip/` directory
- Use zero-padded numbering (e.g., `csip-0007.md`)

---

### 2. CSIP Types

CSIPs are categorized as follows:

#### Core

Defines low-level interfaces, message formats, storage layouts, or protocol-level behavior.

#### Interface

Defines standardized callable methods, opcodes, ABI conventions, or capability identifiers.

#### Informational

Describes design guidelines, best practices, or non-normative recommendations.

#### Meta

Describes a process or governance mechanism (this document is Meta).

---

### 3. CSIP Status

Each CSIP must include one of the following statuses:

- Draft
- Review
- Final
- Deprecated
- Rejected

Status transitions:

Draft → Review → Final  
Draft → Rejected  
Final → Deprecated

Only maintainers may mark a CSIP as Final or Deprecated.

---

### 4. CSIP Lifecycle

1. Author creates Draft proposal.
2. Community discussion via Pull Request.
3. Revisions are made.
4. Proposal moves to Review.
5. After sufficient consensus and implementation readiness, it becomes Final.

Major changes to a Final CSIP require a new CSIP number.

Minor clarifications may update the existing document without changing the number.

---

### 5. Versioning

Each CSIP must include a version field:

version: 1.0.0

Rules:

- PATCH — editorial or clarification changes
- MINOR — backward-compatible additions
- MAJOR — breaking changes (should generally require a new CSIP)

---

### 6. Backwards Compatibility

Each CSIP must explicitly state:

- Whether it is backward compatible
- Migration considerations (if applicable)

---

### 7. Reference Implementation

If applicable, a CSIP should include:

- Reference contract implementation
- ABI definition
- Message/opcode table
- Example usage

Reference implementations may live in a separate repository but must be linked.

---

### 8. Capability Identifiers (Recommended)

When defining optional features, CSIPs should define machine-readable capability identifiers:

capability: "nft.referral.v1"  
capability: "rewards.multi_tier.v1"

# CSIP-<number>: <Title>

## Abstract

Short (1–3 paragraph) summary of the proposal.

## Motivation

Explain the problem being solved and why it matters.

## Specification

Provide precise, normative definitions.

Use RFC-style terminology where appropriate:

- MUST
- MUST NOT
- SHOULD
- SHOULD NOT
- MAY

### Interface Definition (if applicable)

Define:

- Required methods
- Opcodes
- Message formats
- Storage layout
- Events (if applicable)

### Capability Identifier (if applicable)

capability: "<identifier>"

## Rationale

Explain design decisions and alternatives considered.

## Backwards Compatibility

Describe compatibility guarantees and migration strategy.

## Security Considerations

List potential attack vectors and mitigation strategies.

## Reference Implementation

Link or embed a minimal implementation.
